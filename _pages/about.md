I am a doctoral student in Computer Science at the University of Manchester specializing, with a particular emphasis on multi-agent learning and applications of AI. 
I am supervised by [Dr. Wei Pan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GqryWPsAAAAJ&hl) and co-supervised by [Prof. Angelo Cangelosi](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=NyoHewcAAAAJ&hl=en). Before starting PhD journey, I obtained the Master degree in Information and Communication Engineering from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences under [Prof. Jun Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wIE1tY4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Yang Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dC5WplwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and the Bachelor degree in Digital Media Technology from Dalian University of Technology.

My recent research focuses on multi-agent learning in open-ended worlds, aiming to improve the adaptability of multi-agent systems to varying tasks, emergent on-the-fly co-players, and other evolving environments. The ultimate aim of my research is to advance multi-agent interaction in real-world applications where unpredictability is the norm.
